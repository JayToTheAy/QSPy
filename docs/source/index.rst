Introduction
============
``qsyplib`` is a bundle of API wrappers for various amateur radio-related websites, including QRZ, LOTW, eQSL, and ClubLog.

It is currently in development and should be considered unstable version-to-version while the version number is still 0.x.x.

Issues and pull requests are welcome, and should be made on the GitHub repository.
