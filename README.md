# QSPy

QSPy is a bundle of API wrappers for various amateur radio-related websites, including QRZ, LOTW, eQSL, and ClubLog.

It is currently in development and should be considered unstable version-to-version while the version number is still 0.x.x.

Issues and pull requests are welcome, and should be made on this repository.

## What works right now?

As of v0.0.1:

* The LotW module is, in theory, finished -- no doubt something will come up about how it's not actually practical and needs more work.
* The eQSL module has most of the functionality of eQSL's API, but is incredibly unpolished and needs more work.
* The QRZ module exists; the Logbook API is currently only supported for FETCH operations, and the XML Interface is not supported yet.
* The ClubLog module is on-hold pending the ready-status of the other modules.
